# RosalindProblems

This program is supposed to generate answers to the problems on the Rosalind.info website.
It was created strictly to make the problem solving for the site more entertaining instead of
just creating trivial (might be debatable on that claim) solutions in a single file. As I solve
more of the problems I'll add more to the program.
